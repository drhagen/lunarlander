<p align="center" class="style1 style3">About the Case! in! Space! Lunar Lander Project</p>
<p align="center" class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style2">Shortly after the conclusion of the Race! at! Case!, we broke into President Hundert's secret laboratory in an effort to see what other inciting and provocative plans he might have for the current crop of Case students. We thought we were doing a good job of being sneaky, but our vibrating cell phones and flashing iPod Shuffles must have given away our location, as we were soon caught by guards and taken to meet the big H himself. We feared for our tuitions, but luckily Hundert had other things in mind - he needed our help with his next big project, Case! in! Space!. The project, just recently started, was already well over budget, and he was looking for some people to voluntarily (read: in exchange for not failing out of college) provide Case! in! Space! with a little more manpower.</p>
<p class="style2">So. Here before you is the Case! in! Space! mission: Using your mad skillz, land the Case! in! Space! lunar lander on the surface of the moon, being careful not to destroy the lander through mishandling. If you succeed, the Case! in! Space Initiative will be able to begin colonization for the Most Powerful Learning Environment... in the Universe!</p>
<p class="style2">For Cleveland! For the galaxy!</p>
